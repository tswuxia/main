== Introduction

EzWatchList is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing movies and tv series watchlist*. More importantly, EzWatchList is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EzWatchList can get your watchlist faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ezwatchlist.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your watchlist.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add`**`Titanic` : adds the movie named `Titanic` to the Watchlist.
* **`search`**`Titanic` : Searched for movie named `Titanic` in all movies
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd movie shown in the current list
